Goal: refactor generated code for usart initialization.

1. 	Do some analysis. DONE.
2. 	Planing to test HAL_UART_MspInit().
3. 	The first case says uart clock should be enabled after the function is called.
	call HAL_UART_MspInit(huart), compilation error.
	declare and initialize a test struct. (copy code from MX_USART2_UART_Init), compilation pass.
	add test case to test group runner and call group runner in main.c
4.	Add tool function uart_clock_enabled(), add assertion, test failed.
